### Course Description
Big data and computational methods for its analysis are changing scientific and humanities research, financial markets, political campaigning, higher education and countless other areas, and also affect our everyday lives. Our daily existence is increasingly structured by software systems that process massive amounts of data and generate results such as music and book recommendations, search engines outputs, car routes, airline prices, and advertising content.

In this course, we explore the social, political, and cultural impact of our society’s reliance on massive (and often real-time) data analysis. We will discuss the concepts behind data collection, organization, analysis, visualization, and publication. We will also discuss possibilities, limitations, and implications of using big data-centric methods in social science and humanities research, and the already developed work in computational social science, digital humanities and cultural analytics fields. Students will become familiar with the history and basic concepts of the fundamental paradigms developed by modern societies to analyze patterns in data—statistics, visualization, data mining, and machine learning. 

The course will be structured around four broad concepts that inform data studies: defining data, algorithms, networks, and terms of service. This way, we will look at problems such as: how do we define data and where does it reside, what cultural values are encoded in the algorithms that present data to us, how does data travel unequally in the world, and how does big cultural data impact individuals and society. 

Students will be expected to participate in class discussions, contribute to a weekly course blog, to present an oral presentation on a data case study (e.g., Cambridge Analytica, Facebook and election targeting, net neutrality, the EU’s Right to Be Forgotten, Nate Silver and the 2016 election, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, APIs, Edward Snowden, *Moneyball*, Amazon Alexa and the internet of things, or the Memex), and to write a final reseach paper.

### Learning Objectives
* Students will be able to understand and explain the roles that data plays in contemporary culture and society as well as its limitations in various areas of research, industry and modern life. 
* Students will be able to read, understand, assess, and discuss data-oriented professional and popular publications and articles.
* They will also be able to advance arguments about data analysis cases, data infrastructure, and data applications.


### Assessment
* Class participation is crucial in this course. There will be ample opportunities for discussion in each class, and graded weekly presentations on the readings will be assigned. 
* In lieu of a midterm exam, students will write a series of blog posts examining theoretical concepts discussed in class, connecting them to a current event having to do with data.
* The final assignment consists of an oral presentation and a research paper. 


### Requirements and Structure:

**Weekly Class Sessions and Blogging**

* Weekly readings in advance of class sessions and public presentations.
* Students are responsible for writing five blog posts on our shared course blog, connecting a current news event to the week's reading. These should be posted by Friday night so that peers have the weekend to respond before Tuesday's class. Students should complete at least five of these over the semester. 
* Students who are not writing blog posts on a given week should comment on and respond to the posts of other students.


**Presentation**

* Students will sign up for a presentation on one of the following topics (or similar with prior approval): Cambridge Analytica, Facebook and election targeting, net neutrality, the EU’s Right to Be Forgotten, Nate Silver and the 2016 election, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, APIs, Edward Snowden, *Moneyball*, Amazon Alexa and the internet of things, or the Memex. The presentation should briefly describe the history and background of the topic; describe the central theoretical, ethical, or political problem(s) the topic provokes; and show how the topic relates to course content. 

* Over the course of the semester, students will generate data about themselves. This data could be physical, emotional, habitual (steps walked, hours slept, minutes riding on MTA, pages read, spiciness of food eaten). You should track at least two variables and make observations at least 4 days a week. We will share and visualize this data later in the semester.


**Final Projects**

* [details to come]


**Grading** 

* Regular participation in discussions across the range of our face-to-face and online course spaces is essential. There will also be an emphasis throughout the course on online participation through various projects and weekly online discussions that will contribute to your final grade. (30%)

* Presentation (20%)

* Final project (50%)

**Accounts** 

Immediately following the first class, all students should register for accounts on [CUNY Academic Commons](https://commons.gc.cuny.edu/)
